# jjjhill.github.io
-I made this site to act as a virtual resume, but also to showcase my skills as a front-end developer. I used the React library for conditional rendering of the sections, and for componentization of some of the key features. Other than this, all web components were designed and engineered by myself using HTML5 and CSS3.
-I used CSS grid paired with keyframes for the home page animation.
-I made a completely customizable Timeline functional component using React Hooks and published to NPM (source code and documentation here: https://github.com/jjjhill/react-static-timeline).
-The skills section carousels were engineered using the CSS transform, "rotate3d", with the angle being incremented automatically to give the rotating effect. The user can also click and drag to rotate the carousel.
-The Contact me page sends a POST to the 3rd party service, Formspree, which sends me the email.
-All sections are also designed to work very well on mobile. Try it out!
